Central repository containing submodule links to all relevant code and data
used throughout my final research project and dissertation during my MSc. For my
MSc Research Project, I am assessing the potential role of two alternative
sampling/monitoring approaches that have been proposed as means of gathering
affordable and time-efficient large-scale data sets for biodiversity monitoring
and ecological research.

More specifically I am investigating the use of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM)
by use of audiomoth devices; and citizen science initiatives, through human point
count surveys, for bird biodiversity monitoring.

As it stands, the first phase of my project will assess the appropriate survey
design for audiomoths in the field, within 1-2 main habitat types. This will
involve looking at species accumulation curves and rarefaction curves with both
temporal and spatial sampling effort.

The second phase will compare and contrast the data obtained using audiomoths
with that obtained through citizen science initiatives (i.e. bird watching
challenges left for members of the public to fill out).

I am currently still in the planning stages of this project, with an upcoming
submission deadline for my written project proposal in April.
